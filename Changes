Revision history for HTML-Widget-Factory

{{$NEXT}}
        - in plugins that subclass Input, be sure to pass all arguments when
          calling SUPER::rewrite_args; this should eliminate some warnings
          when adding default classes

0.201     2014-02-24 13:58:58-05:00 America/New_York
        - fix AUTOLOAD method to skip CLONE and DESTROY

0.200     2014-02-21 16:17:04-05:00 America/New_York
        - plugins are no longer blessed into newly created, managed packages,
          but use AUTOLOAD to dispatch to plugins
        - plugins on the factory are stored as objects, not class names
        - the Input, Password, and Textarea plugins have been given a
          default_classes attribute

0.101     2013-09-14 18:35:29 America/New_York
        - fix bugs in default object caching; this code really needs to be
          slashed, burned, and replanted
        - fix bugs in dist metadata

0.100     2013-09-12 14:53:50 America/New_York
        - plugins are no longer exporters; the factory factory interrogates
          them to build the new factory

        - there is a private, experimental method to allow the factory factory
          to build tweaked widget method when installing; read the source for
          more

        - repackage to update bugtracker and repo

0.061     2007-10-02
          BUG FIX: do not allow 'id' attribute to trickle from widget params to

0.060     2007-09-04
